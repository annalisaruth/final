	<p class="flow-text">	The world is in a constant state of peril. As of right now, it has managed to survive every catastrophic event thrown its way; mass extinction, multiple pandemics, volcanic disasters, threats of complete nuclear destruction. However, there is one impending disaster that the world is unlikely to survive- climate change. For the last several years, environmental scientists have been urging us to end harmful practices, such as polluting our oceans with massive landfills and cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions, in order to minimize our negative effect on the planet. Now, scientists are warning us that “ we’ll need to reduce global carbon emissions by as much as 40 percent by 2030” (Turrentine) or else we will enter a state of climate catastrophe. The National Resources Defense Council has stated that, “The extreme droughts, devastating wildfires, massive floods, deadly hurricanes, and widespread famines that we’re seeing more and more of these days will cease to be statistical anomalies and instead be more like seasonal markers, as regular as the changing of the leaves” (Turrentine). Come 2030, everyone will be faced with climate catastrophe. Despite this immediate threat, very little has been done by communities to stop climate change. How is it that now, in an era where humans are globally connected more than ever, that less is being done than in other times of great distress?  We are living in an age where collective action is now being achieved through methods of inaction. </p>

			<p class="flow-text">	Collective action was first theorized by economist and social scientist Mancur Olson in his work The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups. He theorizes that collective action comes from incentive, meaning that individuals will not cooperate in order to achieve a common goal unless there is enough concrete evidence to show that there efforts are not in vain. Collective action can take on many different forms such as, “...tracking disease outbreaks, averting climate change, addressing global financial crises…” (Rueschemeyer 1) etc.. Through widespread cooperation, these goals were achieved in order to avoid catastrophe. Olson’s theory on collective action has been cited in a number of economic, psychological, and sociological articles as the authority on matter.  In one academic journal, Olson’s theory is further explained,“Olson argued that rational actors would not contribute to efforts to attain collective goals except under special conditions” (Rueschemeyer 1). This is critical to beginning to understand why, despite the plethora of information urging humans to reduce their waste and minimize their carbon footprints, still choose to act in harmful ways. According to the NRDC, “some 90 climate scientists from 40 countries conclude that if humans don’t take immediate, collective action to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040, the consequences will effectively be baked into the natural systems of the planet” (Turrentine).

			<p class="flow-text">	Collective action has proven time and time again to be beneficial in cases where entire communities are under attack by some adversity. During the eighteenth century, the Bubonic Plague, commonly referred to as the Black Death, swept through Europe killing a third of the continent’s population. At this time, Europeans relied on methods of collective action in order to eradicate the epidemic; “ Plague victims were isolated and their contacts traced and incarcerated. There were restrictions on movement, bills of health, quarantine regulations for travelers and shipping. Bedding and houses were fumigated”(Slack 1). Without cooperation from individuals, public health initiatives are bound for failure. Modern day vaccinations are a form of collective action- an individual must make the conscious choice to receive a vaccination in order to help the greater good of the group by not spreading disease. When U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt created the United States Forest Services as a federal act of conservation, he relied on collective action to not only pass the bill, but to maintain and care for the new 150 national forests and 5 national parks . He saw a need for the American wildlife to be protected after watching the devastating depletion of the natural resources that surrounded him. It takes massive organizations, not just government agencies, but industries as well, to participate in collective action in order to create a lasting impact. </p>

			<p class="flow-text">Considering the fact that collective action relies on complete cooperation of all parties, it is reasonable to expect issues to arrive. The collective action problem has been defined as “a scenario in which there is conflict between the individual interest and the group interest. In the scenario, each individual in the group faces a choice to either be selfish or cooperate”. It is in these choices of selfishness that collective action can come to a screeching halt, ending all chances of work being accomplished. The Department of Geography at Penn State University acknowledged several self-serving behaviors that have aided in environmental decay such as driving cars, using fossil fuels and other depleting resources, and contributing extra greenhouse gasses. This problem leads to collective inaction in which every individual acts according to their own personal agenda, often without consideration for the greater good of the group. By driving a car instead of carpooling or riding public transit, a person is acting in a “selfish” manner, choosing to serve themselves the benefit of having a private ride as opposed to choosing an alternative that causes less harm to the environment. The difference between collective action and inaction can make or break a conflict entirely.  It takes one post saying “bUt MEtaL StRaWS aRE pOintLEsS!!!!” and a hundred people could become discouraged from taking the first small step in not being a disrespectful to the planet.  For every post promoting sustainability, there is a post claiming climate change is a hoax. It comes to the point of a complete standstill with no work being done by either party because they have become too caught up in the argument. </p>

			<p class="flow-text"> But is it possible for every single person to be acting “selfishly”? Is it accurate to claim that every human is consciously behaving with malicious intent to destroy the planet? Or is it, that we think we are doing our part in helping the environment while simultaneously expecting somebody else to do the work? Now with social media, we are able to “do our part” with likes and retweets, by passing on information on how to stop climate change in the hopes that someone will see it on their feed and take action. We can electronically sign petitions that may or may not be seen by government officials. We can order an entire set of reusable straws and tote bags through Amazon and have them deliver in plastic filled boxes that we may or may not be too lazy to dispose of properly. We can take steps to reduce waste while awaiting others to take the steps to break down the damaging practices of large industries. There is a certain lure, a call to action, to hit the ‘share’ button right before bed, as the feeling of success from a pious action lulls you to sleep. </p>

			<p class="flow-text"> Or maybe it isn’t because one guy decides to toss his plastic water bottle into the trash bin because the recycling bin is out of his way even despite his twitter feed is full of plastic pierced sea turtles. Maybe it is because of giant corporations finding it profitable to maintain their unsustainable practices rather than listening to the specialists demanding they stop. Maybe its because “100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions since 1988.” ( Fibieger Byskov).  These industries are creating a collective action problem; the interests of companies like ExxonMobil, British Petroleum (BP), and Gazprom are not aligning with the interests of climate change experts. With an extensive use of social media, it can become easy to get caught up in all of the ways to improve individual behaviors, but that is just a drop in the oil slick ocean. Experts still give these companies warnings, yet there do not seem to be any changes occurring. For these large companies, climate change is a concern of the future, however there will not be one for much longer; “If the fossil fuel industry and high-polluting countries are not forced to change, we will be on course to increase global average temperatures by 4°C by the end of the century” (Fibieger Byskov). </p>

			<p class="flow-text"> It is very likely that Olson would be extremely disappointed to know that his theory of collective action does not seem to apply when the world is faced with climate catastrophe. There may not be one answer as to why there seems to be a lack of effort to take action, despite it being in everyone’s best interest to keep the world from reaching the point of no return. However, one thing is clear-People are offered solutions and alternatives, yet still decline. Whether it is the fault of the individual or industries, something has to be done if there is any hope of a bright future past 2030. As of right now, the world has survived every major disaster its faced, but it can’t go on like that forever unless individuals and industries come together, collectively, to put an end to it. It’s the end of the world as you know it. Or at least that’s what R.E.M told me as I walked down the freezing Greenwich Village streets, thinking about how it was 35º even though it had been 64º just two days prior, feeling my heart rate rise a bit while the number 2030 echoed in the back of my head, freaking out that the world was going to implode before me. But at least I got an essay out of it. And I feel fine. </p>
